  <li>Electronic Scales</li>
  <li>Older Windows Versions/32 bit (if there's demand)</li>
  <li>Enhanced printer output, filters</li>
  <li>Linux version</li>
</ul>


<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Very fast and lightweight, made in native C++</li> 
  <li>Very easy to set up, remembers your settings and printer</li>
  <li>Silent, unintrusive, can start in the system tray</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quick start guide</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Install the POSAgent module from the odoo app store (link at the bottom of the page)</li> 
  <li>Enable and set up in your Point of Sale configuration area:
    <div>
      <img src="img/posagent.png"></img>
    </div>
  </li> 

  <li>Download the POSAgent desktop client (link)</li> 
</ul>
    Make sure you have a network port matching the one configured
in the point of sale, 9069 is the default in both cases, this typically works out of the box, 
then chose a printer driver and set it up accordingly.
